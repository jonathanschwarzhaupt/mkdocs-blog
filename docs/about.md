Hi there! 👋 I'm Jonathan, and I'm passionate about building robust data systems that deliver real business value - systems that not only work today but evolve sustainably over time.

## My Journey
I started my career path in business, completing both my bachelor's and master's degrees in business studies. During my MSc in Business Analytics, I discovered my true calling - the technical side of data. This unique background gives me a perspective that bridges the gap between business stakeholders and engineering teams - I speak both languages fluently, which helps me build solutions that actually solve the right problems.

## What I Do
As a Data Engineer based in Munich, I architect and implement end-to-end data solutions with a focus on continuous improvement and automation. My role spans from setting up cloud infrastructure and designing data pipelines to optimizing workflows and ensuring data quality through automated monitoring and observability.
I'm particularly experienced with Microsoft Azure, where I architect and deploy cloud resources ranging from data lakes to analytics services. I'm also a Microsoft Certified [Azure Data Engineer](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/JonathanSchwarzhaupt-5816/A432492773D7B593?sharingId=18F3986EE2A538EB) and [Azure Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/?practice-assessment-type=certification)!

I work extensively with both cloud-native services and open source tools, believing that the right solution often combines the best of both worlds. My approach is always guided by focusing the technical solution on business requirements and to iterate and improve systems over time. I believe the best data infrastructure evolves with the business it serves.

## Technical Skills
- Languages: Python, SQL, bits of Go and learning Bash
- Cloud: Microsoft Azure ecosystem, AWS
- Data Tools: Airflow, DuckDB, dlt, dbt and others (I enjoy exploring new tools that improve productivity) learnign new ones
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes

## Beyond Engineering
In my free time, you can find me on the field hockey pitch where I've been playing competitively for over 15 years. I also enjoy exploring Munich's golf courses and discovering new corners of this beautiful city.

When I get the chance, working with data extends into my free time. I work on personal projects and am learning more about Azure, Linux, and Kubernetes. Currently, I'm building an analytics platform to better understand my personal finances and building a custom React-based frontend for it. These projects let me explore new tools and technologies and provide an opportunity to apply my evolving technical skills.

I'm always excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts and professionals. Check out my [blog](./blog/index.md)!
